Hello world!

My name is **PHAN Vy Hao** and I am a **Data Scientist** with 2+ years of experience in the field. I am the most passionate about LLM models and their applications in improving business processes. 

I find it really interesting to join in this AI revolution where all the things are changing so fast by the hand of AI, especially since the appearance of OpenAI. This is also the reason why I am eager to learn and share my knowledge with this blog here.

All my posts here are about my professional experiences and my personal/ freelance projects. I hope my experience contributes something to the AI passioners out there.
