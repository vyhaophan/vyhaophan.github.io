      "summary": "This paper proposes a two-stage deep learning based algorithm for license plate reconstruction in parking lot management systems. The first stage uses YOLOv4 transfer learning to detect license plate positions, while the second stage employs Pix2Pix GAN to reconstruct poor quality, unrecognizable license plate images into perceptible ones. The system aims to enhance license plate image quality for both human and computer recognition."
